# Hello-Maps
This is a place of Mapping the Nigeria of my dream.
Hi, I read geography at the undergrad. Year two into undergrad, i stumbled on GIS and my passion for it cannot be quenched. Need more. So, am going web-mapping. Want to know more. Thanks.
Currently tryimg to help Nigeria and other sub-sahara Africa countries to leverage the goodies of GIS.
